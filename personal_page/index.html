	<p>I was raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno,_California">Fresno, California</a> and attended <a href="http://chs.cusd.com/">Clovis High School</a>.  In 1988, I moved to Queens, New York, to attend St. John&#8242s University as a finance major.  I worked as a waiter and bartender in Forest Hills to pay the bills.  When I graduated, I enrolled simultaneously in the law school and graduate business programs at St. John&#8242s University.  In 1995, I moved to Washington, DC to work as a law clerk to the Hon. Maurice B. Foley of the <a href="https://www.ustaxcourt.gov/about.htm">United States Tax Court</a>.  In 1997, I returned to New York to live and work in Manhattan.  I joined the law firm of Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts.  While working at Winthrop, I obtained an <a href="http://www.llm-guide.com/what-is-an-llm">LL.M.</a> in taxation from New York University.  In 2002, I moved to San Francisco, California and joined Heller Ehrman as a special counsel.  In 2007, I was made a partner.  In 2008, when Heller Ehrman ceased operations, I joined <a href="http://www.schiffhardin.com/">Schiff Hardin</a> as an equity partner.  In 2013, I left Schiff to start my own firm&#8212<a href="www.zaffrelawhttp://www.schiffhardin.com/">Zaffre Law</a>.</p>
